## Architecture

Tauri v2 desktop app: Rust backend + Vue 3 / TypeScript / Vite frontend. State management via Pinia.

### Data Flow

```
User types in ThreadEditor (contenteditable div)
  → threadStore updates sections[]
  → Cmd/Ctrl+Enter triggers useStreaming.startStreaming()
    → invoke('send_message', { tabId, messages, providerId, modelId, onEvent: Channel })
      → Rust: commands::send_message spawns tokio task
        → ProviderRegistry finds provider by id
        → provider.stream_chat() sends HTTP request, parses SSE
        → tokens sent via mpsc → forwarded to Tauri Channel
    → Frontend Channel.onmessage appends tokens to agent section
    → requestAnimationFrame loop rebuilds DOM during streaming
```

### Frontend (`src/`)

- **Single contenteditable surface** — `ThreadEditor.vue` is NOT a traditional chat UI. It's one `contenteditable="true"` div that imperatively manages its own DOM via `buildDOM()`. The store is the source of truth; DOM is rebuilt from store state (not the other way around for structure). Text edits sync back to the store via `readDOMToStore()` on input events.
- **Sections model** — A conversation is `Section[]` where each section has `{ id, role: 'user'|'agent', content }`. Pill separators between sections are non-editable DOM elements rendered inline. Shift+Enter splits into a new section.
- **Stores**: `tabStore` owns all tab state (including sections and activeModel per tab). `threadStore` is a computed proxy over the active tab's data. `settingsStore` persists to disk via `@tauri-apps/plugin-store`.
- **Composables**: `useStreaming` manages the streaming lifecycle. `useKeyboardShortcuts` handles global shortcuts. `useMessageParser` and `useCodeHighlighter` handle rendering concerns.
- **Streaming state** (`isStreaming`, `streamingTabId`, `streamingError`) uses module-level refs in `useStreaming.ts` — these are shared singletons across all component instances, not per-composable-call state.

### Backend (`src-tauri/src/`)

- **Provider trait** — `LlmProvider` in `providers/mod.rs` defines `stream_chat(messages, model, tx)` returning tokens via an unbounded mpsc channel. All providers implement this trait via `#[async_trait]`.
- **SSE parsing** — `stream_openai_sse()` in `providers/mod.rs` is a shared helper for OpenAI-compatible SSE streams. Providers with compatible APIs (OpenRouter, Copilot) reuse it.
- **Generation cancellation** — Each tab's active generation is tracked by `JoinHandle` in `GenerationState`. `cancel_generation` aborts the tokio task. `send_message` auto-cancels any prior generation for the same tab.
- **ProviderRegistry** — Constructed once at startup in `lib.rs`, wrapped in `Arc<Mutex<>>`, and passed as Tauri managed state. Holds the lock during the entire `stream_chat` call (potential bottleneck for concurrent tabs).
- **Error serialization** — `ProviderError` implements `Serialize` manually (as a string) because Tauri command errors must be serializable.

## Gotchas

- **Role mapping**: The app uses `'agent'` internally but OpenAI-compatible APIs expect `'assistant'`. The mapping happens in each provider's `stream_chat()` — see `openrouter.rs:92`. Forgetting this mapping will cause API errors.
- **ThreadEditor DOM management**: `buildDOM()` does a full `innerHTML = ''` and rebuild. The `syncing` flag prevents `readDOMToStore()` from firing during programmatic DOM updates. If you add DOM mutation logic, always check/set this flag.
- **Browser cloning blocks on Enter**: When the user presses Enter inside contenteditable, the browser may clone the `section-block` div. `readDOMToStore()` handles this by grouping blocks with the same `data-section-id`. Don't assume one block per section in DOM.
- **Settings persistence**: Uses `@tauri-apps/plugin-store` with `autoSave: true`, stored in `settings.json`. The `init()` must be called on mount (done in `App.vue`).
- **Tauri Channel streaming**: The frontend passes a `Channel<StreamEvent>` to `invoke()`. The Rust side spawns a task that writes to mpsc, and a second task forwards mpsc → Tauri Channel. The `StreamEvent` is tagged enum (`kind`/`data` in JSON).
- **Providers not yet implemented**: Zed, Copilot, and MiniMax providers exist as stubs with hardcoded model lists. Only OpenRouter has a real `stream_chat` and `list_models` implementation.
- **CSP is disabled**: `tauri.conf.json` sets `"csp": null`. This is intentional during development.
- **Capabilities**: Only `core:default`, `opener:default`, and `store:default` are granted in `capabilities/default.json`. New Tauri plugins need their permissions added here.

## Code Conventions

- Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs with TypeScript
- Pinia stores use the composition API (setup function) style, not options style
- Rust uses `thiserror` for error types, `async-trait` for async trait methods
- No CSS framework — all styles are component-scoped or in `App.vue` global styles using CSS custom properties (`--color-*`)
- IDs generated via `crypto.randomUUID()`
- Theme support: light/dark/system via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` and `prefers-color-scheme` media query
